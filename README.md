1. Income and Expense Analysis
Purpose: To ensure that your cash inflows exceed your outflows, creating a surplus for saving or investing.

Steps:

List all sources of income (salary, business income, passive income like rent or dividends).

Track and categorize all expenses (fixed expenses like rent/mortgage and utilities, and variable expenses like groceries, dining out, entertainment).

Calculate your savings rate (Savings ÷ Income × 100).

2. Savings and Investment Review
Purpose: To determine if you are saving adequately and allocating your funds to grow wealth.

Steps:

Check your savings account balance. Experts recommend saving at least 20% of your income.

Review your investments, such as stocks, mutual funds, fixed deposits, real estate, etc.

Assess whether your investments align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

3. Debt Management
Purpose: To ensure that your debts are under control and being paid off effectively.

Steps:

List all outstanding debts, including credit card balances, personal loans, home loans, etc.

Calculate your debt-to-income ratio (Total Debt Payments ÷ Income × 100). A ratio below 40% is ideal.

Identify high-interest debts and prioritize paying them off first.

4. Emergency Fund Evaluation
Purpose: To check if you are financially prepared for unexpected situations.

Steps:

Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses saved in an easily accessible account.

If you don’t have an emergency fund, start building one by allocating a portion of your monthly savings.

Purpose: To track and control your spending while aligning with your financial goals.

Adjust the budget periodically based on changes in income or expenses.

Contribute regularly to retirement funds such as EPF (Employee Provident Fund), PPF (Public Provident Fund), or NPS (National Pension System).

Estimate your future retirement needs and determine if your current savings plan will meet those needs.

8. Credit Score Check
Purpose: To evaluate your creditworthiness, which impacts your ability to borrow money.
